# supply_chain_simulator
Supply chain simulator for Gies Disruption Lab at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.


## ToDo's
Back-end:
1. Add more events 

Front-end:
1. Use events more
2. Switch to using [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) instead of web3.js because it's much easier to use (in general, and) for production.
  * Why ether.js? Because many more crypto startups (e.g. Uniswap, Balancer Labs, Steemit, SushiSwap, NexusMutual, and more) [in production](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/network/dependents) than web3.js
3. Switch to using Goerli testnet (because it's better for production testing)
4. Add Blocknative's [Notify.js](https://docs.blocknative.com/notify) and [Onboard.js](https://docs.blocknative.com/onboard)âˆ‘
